# Documentation

Play comes with documentation built into the framework, so even if you are not online you can access documentation and the API locally.

To access the local documentation, start your application by typing

```
play run
```

Then go to the special URL /@documentation -- if your server was started on port 9000, this would be [http://localhost:9000/@documentation](http://localhost:9000/@documentation).
