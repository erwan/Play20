a few highlights:

* Move to Scala 2.10 and sbt 0.12. 
* Replace the current Play Promise Scala API by the standard Scala 
Promise API (SIP-14). 
* Introduce "Project templates" hosted on git (a la giter8) and "Scaffolding". 
* Run tests in a forked JVM (to fully suppress PermGen memory leaks). 
* Simplified configuration for thread pools (we have decided to use a 
single akka system for the whole play environment). 
* Scala JSON API improvement (with support for functional validation). 
* Java Async API improvement (HTTP context propagation in asynchronous 
callback, and sequential execution to avoid race conditions). 
* Improve modularization (break the main play artifact into several 
smaller optional ones). 
* Compilation speed improvements (thanks to the new Scala 2.10 
compiler, the sbt 0.12 experimental resident compiler and router changes). 
* Upgrade all dependencies
* improve asset dependency resolution/require support (that is, it should work transparently both at client and server side) [[ticket](https://play.lighthouseapp.com/projects/82401-play-20/tickets/610)]
* SSL support
